# Problem 1
# Create a printNumbers function to print integers from -25 to 20 to the
# console (print in the function)

# def printNumbers():
#     for num in range(-25, 21, 1):
#         print(num)


# printNumbers()

# Problem 2
# Create a function called checkPassword.
# Send two string variables to the checkPassword
# function to check if the strings are equal.
# Return true if they are equal and false if they are not equal.
# Print the function's return value.

def checkPassword():
    userInput = input("Enter a Password")
    password1 = "flash"
    if userInput != password1:
        print("nope")


checkPassword()


# Problem 3
# Write a function that determines if a number passed to it is odd or even.
# Pass a number of your choosing (using input a good idea) and
# then using the result from the function, print if the number was even or not.

# def evenandOdd():




# Problem 4
# Create a function for the challenge that you call from your main
# Create a second function that takes NO parameters
# Create a third function that takes a single greeting parameter
# (ex. Howdy) and returns a string using the passed in greeting and
# 'World' (ex. Howdy World!)
# From your first function, call the function(s) and
# print out the final result returned


# Problem 5:
# We will keep having this problem until EVERYONE gets it right without help
# Create a function that has a loop that quits with ‘q’.
# If the user doesn't enter 'q', ask them to input another string.

# def Quitting():
#     userInput = ""
#     while userInput != "q":
#         userInput = input("Enter another sentence")
#         print(userInput)

# Quitting()
